Key Features
	Binary Search Tree (BST)
	AVL Tree
	Min-Heap

Functionality
BST and AVL Tree Operations:
•	Insertion: Add nodes to the tree while maintaining the BST or AVL properties.
•	Search: Find a node with a specific value.
•	Deletion: Remove a node from the tree.
Traversals:
•	In order Traversal: Visit nodes in increasing order.
•	Preorder Traversal: Visit nodes in the order of root, left subtree, and right subtree.
•	Post order Traversal: Visit nodes in the order of left subtree, right subtree, and root.
Min-Heap Operations:
•	Insertion: Add nodes to the heap while maintaining the heap property.
•	Heapify Up: Restore the heap property after insertion.
•	Print Heap: Visualize the heap structure.
Visualization:
•	Use graphical functions to draw trees and heap structures.
